# Data_Processing_Using_Spark_And_Scala
## About The Project

[\* This was an academic project]

The theme of this project is to use Spark to perform data preprocessing in two different development environments, which are the Ganymede HPC development environment and the localized IntelliJ IDEA development environment. 

For the Ganymede HPC command-line development environment, the main components of the code are entering Spark-Shell, importing data, observing data structures, clearing null values, correcting data types, and exporting to JSON data files. 

For the IntelliJ IDEA compiler development environment, the main components of the code are: first build the required Scala development environment, then update the build.sbt file to obtain the relevant spark toolkit, then build a local Spark Session, and finally perform similar data Pre-processing operation and export JSON data file. 

In addition, the data used in this project is the survey data of airline passenger satisfaction, the data source has been marked in the final reference.
